<h1>wxPython 2.9 Migration Guide</h1>
<p>This document will help explain some of the changes in wxPython 2.9
since the 2.8 series that may cause some issues when migrating
existing applications to the new version of wxPython.  For a list of
new things that have been added to wxPython, and the not so major
changes that are not documented here, be sure to read the <a class="reference external" href="CHANGES.html">CHANGES</a>
file like usual.</p>
<div class="section" id="aliases-removed-or-deprecated">
<h2>Aliases Removed or Deprecated</h2>
<p>Over the years there have been a number of aliases that I added to
wxPython that seemed like a good idea at the time, but really just
added to the clutter.  Many of these have been removed in the 2.9
release series.  Unfortunately a list of removed names wasn't kept,
but they should be obvious when you run into them.  For example there
were some aliases for the various wxColour functions, etc. that
allowed the use of the American spelling.  So if you get an exception
about wxColor not being found, just add the extra 'u' to the name and
you'll be all set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grid-sizer-assertions">
<h2>Grid Sizer Assertions</h2>
<p>The grid sizer classes now assert if you specify both the number of
rows and the number of columns in the constructor, and you add more
items than will fit in the specified number of rows.  You can avoid
this assertion simply by specify only the number of columns and let
the sizer work out the number of rows for itself based on the number
of items added to the sizer.  For example, instead of:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sizer = wx.FlexGridSizer(2, 4, 5, 5)
</pre>
<p>You can use:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sizer = wx.FlexGridSizer(cols=4, hgap=5, vgap=5)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="box-sizers-proportional-layout">
<h2>Box Sizers Proportional Layout</h2>
<p>When items in a box sizer have a proportion greater than zero that
indicates that the item should get a portion of the space that is
still available after non-proportional items have been given space.
Prior to 2.9.1 that space was allocated solely based on the proportion
values.  Starting with 2.9.1 the minimum or best size of the items is
checked first, and proportional items will not be made smaller than
their minimum or best size.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-wxpython">
<h2>Building wxPython</h2>
<p>There is now a script called build-wxpython.py that can be used to
build both wxWidgets and wxPython with all the correct options and
flags.  See wxPython/docs/BUILD.txt for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-more-ansi-build">
<h2>No More ANSI Build</h2>
<p>The ANSI builds of wxPython are finally dead and gone.  Long live
Unicode!</p>
<p>If you've always used the ansi builds in the past, or are not familiar
with working with Unicode objects, the recommended way to deal with
this change is to only use encoded string objects at the I/O points of
your application, (e.g., when reading/writing the data to files or a
database) and use Unicode objects everywhere else.  If you have string
literals in your code that are more than just ascii then add the &quot;#
-<em>- coding: [codec name] -</em>-&quot; line at the top of the file, and put a
'u' in front of the string's quotes.  That way those literals will be
Unicode objects from the beginning (compile-time) and won't need to be
decoded at run-time.</p>
<p>This approach will also work in a 2.8 unicode build, so you can start
preparing for the move to 2.9.x by making the changes now while still
working with wxPython 2.8.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wx-textattr-merge">
<h2>wx.TextAttr.Merge</h2>
<p>I don't remember exactly why I did this but in 2.9 I commented out the
static version of wxTextAttr::Merge and uncommented the non-static
method.  So in other words what we have now is a wrapper for:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void Merge(const wxTextAttr&amp; overlay)
</pre>
<p>instead of:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
static wxTextAttr Merge(const wxTextAttr&amp; base, const wxTextAttr&amp; overlay)
</pre>
<p>The non-static version will still do a merge, but will merge it into
self instead of making a new instance of the wx.TextAttr:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
base.Merge(overlay) # base is modified
</pre>
<p>If you prefer the old semantics then you can use the new Combine
static method like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
newAttr = wx.TextAttr.Combine(overlay, base, None)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="miscellaneous-other-stuff">
<h2>Miscellaneous Other Stuff</h2>
<p>DoPrepareDC and PrepareDC are no longer in wx.Window.  They are only
in wx.ScrolledWindow since that is the only place (and in derived
classes) where the methods have any effect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upcoming-changes-in-project-phoenix">
<h1>Upcoming Changes in Project Phoenix</h1>
<p>The remainder of this document describes some migration issues for
Project Phoenix, which will one day replace the current wxPython
implementation.  These changes do not yet apply to any released
version of Python and are currently provided only for informational
purposes and for a glimpse into the future.  For more information
about Project Phoenix please see the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/ProjectPhoenix">ProjectPhoenix</a> pages in the
wiki.</p>
<div class="section" id="overloaded-functions">
<h2>Overloaded Functions</h2>
<p>Up to this point in order to support more than one of the versions of
an overloaded C++ function or class method we have had to rename all
but one of them.  For example, for the wxWindow::SetSize method we
have SetSize, SetDimensions, SetRect and SetSizeWH.  One of the
features of the new tools used for Project Pheonix is that we no
longer need to do that and instead we can have just one function or
method in the Python API and the propper version of the C++ function
or method is chosen at runtime based on the types of parameters passed
to the function.  So in most cases the renamed versions of the
overloaded functions have been removed and you can call the function
with the same name as the C++ API.</p>
<p>This also includes the default constructor for all widget classes,
used for the 2-phase create. Previously they were renamed to to be the
class name with &quot;Pre&quot; prepended to it.  For example, wx.PreWindow(),
wx.PreFrame(), etc.  Now in the Phoenix build of wxPython that is no
longer neccessary and you can just call the class with no parameters
like normal.</p>
<p>For those renamed items that are more commonly used in the old
wxPython I'll add some alias that will issue a DeprecationWarning for
the first release or two after we switch over to the Phoenix version
of the code, and then remove them in a later release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unicode-and-auto-converting-strings">
<h2>Unicode and Auto-Converting Strings</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are no longer separate ansi/Unicode builds
of wxPython starting with the first 2.9.x releases.  All wxPython
builds are now essentially the same as the old Unicode builds. This
means that all string objects passed to wx API functions or methods
are converted to Unicode before calling the C++ function or method.
By default wxPython would use the encoding specified by the locale
that was current at the time of the import of the wx module.</p>
<p>However using the default locale could sometimes cause issues because
it meant that slightly different encodings could be used on different
platforms, even in the same locale, or the program could end up using
an encoding in a different locale that the developer has not tested
their code with.</p>
<p>Project Phoenix takes this Unicode simplification one step further by
stipulating that only the utf-8 encoding will be used for
auto-converting string objects to the Unicode objects that will be
passed on to the wx APIs.  If you need to deal with text using a
different encoding then you will need to convert it to Unicode
yourself before passing the text to the wx API.  For the most part this
should not be much of a problem for well written programs that support
Unicode because they will typically only convert to/from Unicode when
reading/writing text to a file or database, and will use Unicode objects
throughout the rest of the code.  The common exception to this is that
string-literals are often used in the code for specifying labels,
etc. for UI elements.  If your text for the string literals in your
code are all ascii or utf-8 then you should not need to make any
changes at all.  If you have literals with some other encoding then
you'll need to deal with them one way or another, either change the
encoding of your source file to utf-8, or convert the literals from
your encoding to Unicode before passing the text to the wx API.</p>

<div class="section" id="rawcontroldown-and-mac-accelerators">
<h2>RawControlDown and Mac accelerators</h2>
<p>First a little background.  Probably 95% of the places in a Windows or
GTK application where you would use a Ctrl key, the equivalent on Mac
would be to use the Cmd key instead.  For example, the traditional
accelerator for paste is Ctrl-V on Windows and Cmd-V on Macs.  The
reason for this difference is probably lost in the mists of time, so
let's just call it tradition or the quirkiness of Apple.</p>
<p>wxMac does a few things to help cross-platform applications to fit in
and behave more natively on Macs, so one of the first things it did
was to automatically convert things like &quot;Ctrl-V&quot; in menu accelerators
to &quot;Cmd-V&quot;.  Later on we added the concept of the CmdDown and related
modifier flags to help key and char event handlers to not care whether
it is the Control key or the Meta (command) key that is being pressed.
In other words, CmdDown would be True on non-Macs if the Control key
is pressed, and it would be True on Macs if the Command key is
pressed.  If it was implemented in Python code it would look like
this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def CmdDown(self):
    if 'wxMac' in wx.PlatformInfo:
        return self.MetaDown()
    else:
        return self.ControlDown()
</pre>
<p>That was the situation in 2.8.</p>
<p>In 2.9 things have been taken one step further.  I'm not sure all of
the reasons behind this, but one of them was to make it possible to
have real Ctrl accelerators on Mac, in addition to those that get
automatically converted to Cmd accelerators.  So now we have
RawControlDown and associated modifier flags and etc.  On non-Mac
platforms RawControlDown is the same as ControlDown.  On Macs
RawControlDown is used for the real Ctrl key on the keyboard, and
ControlDown is used for the command key.  You can also use accelerator
strings like &quot;RawCtrl-H&quot; in menu items to create an accelerator that
will always use Ctrl on all platforms, and not be converted to Cmd on
Macs.</p>
