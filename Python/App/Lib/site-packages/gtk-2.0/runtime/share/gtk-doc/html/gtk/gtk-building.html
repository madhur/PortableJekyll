<p>
      This chapter covers building and installing GTK+ on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux. Compiling GTK+ on Microsoft
      Windows is different in detail and somewhat more difficult to
      get going since the necessary tools aren't included with
      the operating system.
    </p>
<p>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile GTK+, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GTK+ prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming wih GTK+ much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GTK+ installed on your system
      already.
    </p>
<p>
      On UNIX-like systems GTK+ uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <span class="application">autoconf</span> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <span class="application">automake</span> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <span class="application">libtool</span> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </p>
<p>
      If you are building GTK+ from the distributed source packages,
      then won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <code class="literal">tar.gz</code> or <code class="literal">tar.bz2</code> file 
      which you unpack into a directory full of the source files as follows:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      tar xvfz gtk+-2.0.0.tar.gz
      tar xvfj gtk+-2.0.0.tar.bz2
    </pre>
<p>
      In the toplevel of the directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <code class="filename">configure</code> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <code class="filename">Makefile.in</code> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system. The <code class="filename">configure</code>
      script can be passed various command line arguments to determine how
      the package is built and installed. The most commonly useful
      argument is the <code class="systemitem">--prefix</code> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <code class="filename">/opt/gtk</code> you would run configure as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk
    </pre>
<p>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <code class="filename">configure</code> with the
      <code class="systemitem">--help</code> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <code class="filename">configure</code>, you then run the
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      make
      make install
    </pre>
<p>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <code class="literal">make install</code>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span> after
      <code class="literal">make install</code> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </p>
<p>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <code class="envar">CPPFLAGS</code> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <code class="envar">LDFLAGS</code> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <code class="envar">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable contains
      a search path that <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> (see below)
      uses when looking for for file describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GTK+
      and it's dependencies into <code class="filename">/opt/gtk</code>, you 
      might want to set these variables as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/gtk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gtk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </pre>
<p>
      You may also need to set the <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <code class="envar">PATH</code>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </pre>

      Before you can compile the GTK+ widget toolkit, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating GTK+
      mentioned above such as <span class="application">autoconf</span>)
      are <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> and GNU make.

          in a standard location that contains the compilation flags 
          needed for that library along with version number information.)  
          The version of <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> needed to build

      Three of the libraries that GTK+ depends on are maintained by

<p>
      First make sure that you have the necessary external
      dependencies installed: <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>, GNU make,
      the JPEG, PNG, and TIFF libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
      libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building 
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Then build and install the GTK+ libraries in the order:
      GLib, Pango, ATK, then GTK+. For each library, follow the
      steps of <code class="literal">configure</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>,
      <code class="literal">make install</code> mentioned above. If you're
      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to
      <a class="link" href="gtk-compiling.html" title="Compiling GTK+ Applications">start compiling your own GTK+
	applications</a>. You can test your GTK+ installation
      by running the <span class="command"><strong>gtk-demo</strong></span> program that
      GTK+ installs.
    </p>
<p>
      If one of the <code class="filename">configure</code> scripts fails or running
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> fails, look closely at the error
      messages printed; these will often provide useful information
      as to what went wrong. When <code class="filename">configure</code>
      fails, extra information, such as errors that a test compilation
      ran into, is found in the file <code class="filename">config.log</code>.
      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong. If all else fails, you
      can ask for help on the gtk-list mailing list.

	In addition to the normal options, the

<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code> and
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-modules</code>. </b>
	  Normally GTK+ will try to build the input method modules
	  as little shared libraries that are loaded on
	  demand.  The <code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code>
	  argument indicates that they should all be built statically
	  into the GTK+ library instead.  This is useful for
	  people who need to produce statically-linked binaries.  If
	  neither <code class="systemitem">--disable-modules</code> nor
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-modules</code> is specified, then
	  the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try to
	  auto-detect whether shared modules work on your system.
	</p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--with-included-immodules</code>. </b>
         This option allows you to specify which input method modules you
         want to include. 
	</p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--enable-debug</code>. </b>
         Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to 'no' 
	 disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail() and
         all cast checks between different object types. Setting it to 'minimum'
         disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables 
         <a class="link" href="gtk-running.html#GTK-Debug-Options" title="GTK_DEBUG">runtime debugging</a>. 
         The default is 'minimum'.
         Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize 
         even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs 
         from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus 
         <code class="option">--enable-debug=no</code> should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> 
         be used for stable releases of GTK+.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-visibility</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-visibility</code>. </b>
          The option <code class="systemitem">--disable-visibility</code>
          turns off the use of ELF visibility attributes for linking
          optimizations. This makes sense while changing GTK+ itself,
          since the way in which GTK+ uses visibility attributes 
          forces a full rebuild of all source files for any header
          modification.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--disable-explicit-deps</code>. </b>
	  If <code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> is
	  specified then GTK+ will write the full set of libraries
	  that GTK+ depends upon into its <code class="literal">.pc</code> files to be used when
	  programs depending on GTK+ are linked. Otherwise, GTK+
	  only will include the GTK+ libraries themselves, and
	  will depend on system library dependency facilities to
	  bring in the other libraries.
	  By default GTK+ will disable explicit dependencies unless
	  it detects that they are needed on the system. (If you
	  specify <code class="systemitem">--enable-static</code> to force
	  building of static libraries, then explicit dependencies
	  will be written since library dependencies don't work
	  for static libraries.) Specifying
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-explicit-deps</code> or
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-static</code> can cause
	  compatibility
	  problems when libraries that GTK+ depends upon change
	  their versions, and should be avoided if possible.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-shm</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-shm</code>. </b>
          These options can be used to control whether GTK+ will use shared 
          memory to communicate with the X server when possible.
          The default is 'yes'.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-xkb</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-xkb</code>. </b>
	  By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
	  to auto-detect whether the XKB extension is supported by
          the X libraries GTK+ is linked with.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
	  GTK+ will support the XKB extension. 
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-xinerama</code> and
          <code class="systemitem">--enable-xinerama</code>. </b>
          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to link against the Xinerama libraries if they are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          Xinerama should be used.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-gtk-doc</code> and
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</code>. </b>
	  The <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> package is
	  used to generate the reference documentation included
	  with GTK+. By default support for <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> 
	  is disabled because it requires various extra dependencies
	  to be installed. If you have
	  <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> installed and
	  are modifying GTK+, you may want to enable
	  <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> support by passing
	  in <code class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</code>. If not
	  enabled, pre-generated HTML files distributed with GTK+
	  will be installed.
	</p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--disable-cups</code> and
	  <code class="systemitem">--enable-cups</code>. </b>
          By default the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script will try
          to build the cups print backend if the cups libraries are found.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          the cups print backend should be built.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--with-xinput</code>. </b>
	  Controls whether GTK+ is built with support for the XInput
	  extension. The XInput extension provides an interface
	  to extended input devices such as graphics tablets.
	  When this support is compiled in, specially written
	  GTK+ programs can get access to subpixel positions,
	  multiple simultaneous input devices, and extra "axes"
	  provided by the device such as pressure and tilt
	  information. This is only known to work well on XFree86
	  systems, though other systems do have this extension.
        </p>
<p><b><code class="systemitem">--with-gdktarget</code>. </b>
          Toggles between the supported backends for GDK. 
          The default is x11, unless the platform is Windows, in which
	  case the default is win32. Other supported backends are
          the quartz backend for OS X, and the DirectFB backend
          for the Linux framebuffer.
