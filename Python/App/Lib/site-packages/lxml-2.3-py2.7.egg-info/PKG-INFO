Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        To contact the project, go to the `project home page
        <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
        https://launchpad.net/lxml
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
        you can get it from the subversion repository at
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk .  Note that this requires Cython
        to build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
        page.  To the same end, running Running ``easy_install lxml==dev``
        will install lxml from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/trunk#egg=lxml-dev
        
        
        After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
        available at
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.3 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==2.3bugfix`` will install
        the unreleased branch state from
        http://codespeak.net/svn/lxml/branch/lxml-2.3#egg=lxml-2.3bugfix
        as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.
        2.3 (2011-02-06)
        ================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * When looking for children, ``lxml.objectify`` takes '{}tag' as
          meaning an empty namespace, as opposed to the parent namespace.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * When finished reading from a file-like object, the parser
          immediately calls its ``.close()`` method.
        
        * When finished parsing, ``iterparse()`` immediately closes the input
          file.
        
        * Work-around for libxml2 bug that can leave the HTML parser in a
          non-functional state after parsing a severly broken document (fixed
          in libxml2 2.7.8).
        
        * ``marque`` tag in HTML cleanup code is correctly named ``marquee``.
        
        Other changes
        --------------
        
        * Some public functions in the Cython-level C-API have more explicit
          return types.
